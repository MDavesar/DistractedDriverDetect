# Distracted Driver Detection
## Overview

->This repository contains a machine learning model for detecting distracted drivers. 

->The model utilizes various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
to classify drivers based on their level of distraction.

->Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Visualize results and compare performance across different algorithms.
